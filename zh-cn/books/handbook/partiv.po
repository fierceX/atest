"== Introduction\n"
"\n"
"Introducing network servers and how they work.\n"
"\n"
"=== What is a Network Server?\n"
"\n"
"A network server is a computer or software application that provides resources, such as data files or computing power, to other computers called clients over a network. It handles requests from clients and delivers the requested resources.\n"
"\n"
"=== Types of Network Servers\n"
"\n"
"There are various types of network servers, including:\n"
"\n"
"- File servers: These servers store and manage files, allowing clients to access and share files over a network.\n"
"- Web servers: These servers host websites and respond to requests for webpages from clients.\n"
"- Database servers: These servers store and manage databases, allowing clients to access and manipulate data stored in the database.\n"
"- Mail servers: These servers handle the sending, receiving, and storage of emails.\n"
"- DNS servers: These servers resolve domain names to IP addresses, enabling clients to access websites by their domain names.\n"
"\n"
"=== How Network Servers Work\n"
"\n"
"When a client sends a request to a network server, the server processes the request and provides the requested resources back to the client. This communication happens over a network connection, typically using protocols such as HTTP, FTP, or SMTP.\n"
"\n"
"Network servers are designed to handle multiple client requests simultaneously. They use techniques like multithreading or multiprocessing to efficiently handle concurrent requests.\n"
"\n"
"== Conclusion\n"
"\n"
"In summary, network servers play a crucial role in providing resources and services to clients over a network. Understanding how they work is essential for anyone involved in setting up or maintaining computer networks."
